# Delft3D-Flow
This is a containerized distribution of Delft3D (Version 5.01.00.2163) by Louisiana State University Coastal Resilience Collaboratory (https://crc.cct.lsu.edu/).

Delft3D is a flexible integrated modelling suite, which simulates two-dimensional (in either the horizontal or a vertical plane) and three-dimensional flow, sediment transport and morphology, waves, water quality and ecology is capable of handling the interactions between these processes. The suite is designed for use by domain experts and non-experts alike, which may range from consultants and engineers or contractors, to regulators and government officials, all of whom are active in one or more of the stages of the design, implementation and management cycle.
